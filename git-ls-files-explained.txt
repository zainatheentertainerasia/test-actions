File Type                    Description                                      Command to List
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracked files:               Source Code, README's, INPUTS                    git ls-files
  |                           for your software build/test process
  |
  '-------> & Ignored:       Tracked files that match .gitignore rules,       git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard
                             usually added via 'git add -f <file>'

Untracked files:             Everything else -- object files, binaries,       git ls-files --others
  |                           OUTPUTS of your build/tests
  |
  '-------> & Ignored:       Untracked files that match .gitignore rules      git ls-files --other --ignored --exclude-standard
  |
  '-------> & Not Ignored:   Untracked files not matching .gitignore rules    git ls-files --other --exclude-standard

When would I ever use this?
   * How many files are in your repo's current branch?
   * What is the size of all untracked files produced by your build?
   * Finding a list of committed files that are also ignored as part of a .gitignore rule cleanup.
   * Learning a new large project and want to understand the build/test process
   * Bloated repo cleanup effort, purging files that shouldn't be committed at all.
